# Arma Map Darkmode

Arma Map Darkmode inverts the luminance for almost all elements of the map. Because dark mode is superior.

## Compatibility:
- **Use the ACE version if you are using ACE!**
- Generally incompatible with other mods which modify the colour values of the map or markers. Test it and see yourself, but no promises.
## Features and notes
- 100% client side - server does not require mod/not every user needs this mod
- Serverkey included
- Almost all luminance values of colours are inverted for that easy nighttime viewing! The default black marker is now white, and white markers are now black etc.
- Unfortunately, the engine does not support changing colours after game launch so it can not change mid-mission such as being dark at night.

## Known issues:
- Orange road fills are now black. They should be dark orange, I'm not sure why they are not.
